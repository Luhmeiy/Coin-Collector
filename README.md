## üìö What I Learned

I started this project with the intention of learning more about CRUD, Cloud Firestore and animations in React. It was a way of putting the knowledge I learned by watching different courses and tutorials to the test.

It was a long ride, but it was worth it. Truthfully, there is nothing better than doing a solo project to improve your own knowledge and better your problem solving skills.

Now I have a better understanding of the technologies I use, but I still had the opportunity to learn more about Zod, discover some libraries that I will use in future projects, and even ventured out to learn Figma.
